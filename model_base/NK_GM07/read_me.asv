+ replication: IRF to technology shock  

+ replicated IRFs: FIg4.pdf is fig 4 of the article. Original version with error    
                   FIg4_corrected.pdf is Fig 4 of the article, once the error in the article is addressed    

+ file to produce replicated IRFs: run.m (which calls NK_GM07_error.mod in the folder NK_GM07_rep)

+ Notes on replication:
-   Version of the model with interest rate rule
-   for running the experiments depicted in figures 3-7 of the article adjust parameters mu_1, mu_2, and mu_3 in NK_GM07_rep.mod, in the following way:
    Fig 3: mu_1 = 50;   mu_2 = 0.0; mu_3 = 0.0;
    Fig 4: mu_1 = 1.5;  mu_2 = 0.5; mu_3 = 0.0;
    Fig 5: mu_1 = 50;   mu_2 = 0.0; mu_3 = 0.0;
    Fig 6: mu_1 = 50;   mu_2 = 0.0; mu_3 = 0.0;
    Fig 7: mu_1 = 1.5;  mu_2 = 0.5; mu_3 = 0.8;
- The article features the collateralized EFP (CEFP) and the uncollateralized EFP (UEFP). In terms of log-deviations from 
    their steady states they are equal, and the authors simply use EFP as a notation. On page 1498 of the article the authors
    introduce the equation: EFP=w+m-c. Here, w,m,c are log-deviations from their respective steady state values. 
    
    To reproduce the results of the original article, treat the CEFP and UEFP as log-devations in the definition of the EFP 
    and inconsistently as absolute deviations in equations 20 and 21. (then only EFP features in the code as UEFP and CEFP share the same log-deviation)
    
    To attain the correct result, use both variables, CEFP and UEFP, and remove the equation EFP=w+m-c,
    and use the equations CEFP/CEFP_ss=hat_w+hat_m-hat-c and UEFP/UEFP_ss=hat_w+hat_m-hat-c in the code. Now, CEFP and UEFP are in absolute deviations 
    and 
    
    The external finance premium EFP appears In both codes, the interest rates are absolute deviations from their respective steady state values.
    To reproduce the results of the original article, one can use the equation: EFP=w+m-c, which is stated on page 
    and interpret EFP as the log-deviation of the external finance premium from its steady state value. 
    However, the
