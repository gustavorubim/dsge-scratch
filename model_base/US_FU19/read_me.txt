+ replicated models corresponds to the baseline model (estimated on 1984-2007 data) and the model estimated on the extended sample (1984-2015).

+ IRFs: the file run.m code produces the IRFs depicted in figures E.16, E.19 and E.21 
       of the appendix as well as their counterparts for the model estimated on the extended sample

+ notes on replication: the original code was provided by the authors. The equations in the code are consistent with the equations in the paper.
                        The IRFs are produced by using the parameter values of the posterior means provided in the Appendix (Tables D.2 and F.5)
