+ They are a Dynare version of: Meh and Moran. 2010. "The Role of Bank 
	Capital in the Propagation of Shocks", JEDC 34: 555-576
+ the files were written Nov 2010 - March 2011

+ control produces figures for a decline/increase in the interest rate/technology/bank capital 
+ the figures produced differ slightly from the figures displayed in the paper.
	- e.g. the responses of the financial variables to the technology shock 
          are less persistent than in the paper, and the decline in output is less 
	  pronounced. 
	- however qualitatively the results of the paper are preserved. 
	- The case without bank capital is not reproduced. 
		- in order to do this, the author recommend solving for the stst. using mu_ss = 0.025, and use mu_ss in the dynamics of the model
		 (see BankCapital.mod)
