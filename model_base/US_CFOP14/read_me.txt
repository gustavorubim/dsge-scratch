US_CFOP14 Replication

+ all versions of the model (JPT, BGG and Rk-indexation) replicated for IRFs

+ only the Rk-indexation model included in the Macro Model Data base

+ JPT (i.e., Justiniano et al. 2011) model is also in the Macro Model Data base but under the parameterization estimated by JPT

+ last change: 2016-03-11

+ replication: IRF to marginal efficiency of investment (s.d. shock as estimated under BGG version) 
               IRF to net worth (s.d. shock as estimated under BGG version)
	       IRF to idiosyncratic variance (s.d. shock as estimated under BGG version)
               IRF to monetary policy (s.d. shock as estimated under BGG version)

+ replicated IRFs: US_CFOP14_irf_mei.pdf (marginal efficiency of investment shock)
                   US_CFOP14_irf_nw.pdf (net worth shock)
		   US_CFOP14_irf_iv.pdf (idiosyncratic variance shock) 
		   US_CFOP14_irf_mp.pdf (monetary policy shock) 

+ file to produce replicated IRFs: run.m (which calls .mod files for each version of the model in the folder US_CFOP14_rep)

+ original IRFs: figure 3a on page 142 in Carlstrom et al. 2014 (marginal efficiency of investment shock)
  		 figure 3b on page 143 in Carlstrom et al. 2014 (net worth shock)
		 figure 3c on page 144 in Carlstrom et al. 2014 (idiosyncratic variance shock)
		 figure 3d on page 145 in Carlstrom et al. 2014 (monetary policy shock)
