US_PM08fl Replication

+ last change: 2011-08-31

+ replication:  IRF to a supply shock (RES_PIE_US),
                IRF to a demand shock (RES_Y_US),
                IRF to a policy rate shock (RES_RS_US),
                IRF to a BLT shock (RES_BLT_US)

+ replicated responses of variables:    output (Y_US),
                                        inflation (PIE_US4),
                                        interest rate (RS_US)
Note: responses of only three out of seven variables were replicated due to
        the fact that the model was simplified and stationarized to be run 
        in Dynare
        

+ replicated IRFs: US_PM08fl_irf.pdf
