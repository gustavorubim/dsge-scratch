CA_LS07 Replication

+ last change: 2011-08-23

+ replication: IRF to monetary shock 
               IRF to terms of trade shock
               IRF to row output shock
               IRF to row inflation shock	
Note: the IRFs in the paper are Bayesian impulse responses, 
    hence the replicated impulse responses do not match the IRFs in the paper precisely;
    the impulse responses for monetary, TOT, row output and row inflatuion shock do qualitatively match the
    IRFs in the paper; we are not able to qualitatively replicate the IRFs for the technology shock
