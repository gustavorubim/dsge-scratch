CA_LS07 Replication

+ last change: 2010-08-23

+ replication: IRF to monetary shock 
               IRF to terms of trade shock
               IRF to row output shock
               IRF to row inflation shock	
Note: the IRFs in the paper are Bayeesian impulse responses, 
    hence the replicated impulse responses do not match the IRFs in the paper precisely;
    the impulse responses do qualitatively
