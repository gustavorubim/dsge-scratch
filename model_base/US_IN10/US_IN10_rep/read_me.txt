US_IN10 Replication

+ last change: 2012-08-15

+ replication: 


The file US_IN10_rep includes the code for both flexible economy and sticky price and sticky wages economy.
The flexible economy code was added by M. Lalik and A. Mazany.
The sticky price and sticky wages code was taken from Matteo Iacoviello website: https://www2.bc.edu/~iacoviel/.
The part of the original code referring to the estimation routines was removed.

This file replicates impulse responses to all 9 shocks included in the Iacoviello - Neri model.
However, the IRFs of only 3 of those shocks are included in their paper:
eps_j - is a housing preference shock. IRFs displayed on page 141
eps_e - is a monetary policy shock. IRFs displayed on 143
eps_h - is a housing technology shock. IRFs displayed on page 145
